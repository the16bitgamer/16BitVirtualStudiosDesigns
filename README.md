# 16 Bit Virtual Studios Designs
These are the many 3D Models and Designs which I've made in FreeCad for 16 Bit Virtual Studios. This Repo doesn't include the STL of my designs as the Publically avaliable versions are avaliable on other 3D Printing Repo's.

Like Pintables: https://www.printables.com/social/235770-16-bit-virtual-studios/models

and Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/16bitgames/designs

The models are made in FreeCad
