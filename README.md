# 16 Bit Virtual Studios Designs
These are the many 3D Models and Designs which I've made in FreeCad for 16 Bit Virtual Studios. This Repo doesn't include the STL of my designs as the Publically avaliable versions are avaliable on other 3D Printing Repo's.

The models are made in FreeCad

Added to this repository is our original Fusion 360 designs as *.f3d files. These files are copywrite 16 Bit Virtual Studios are are for non-commercial use, as they were designed with Fusion 360 Personal Edition. Many of the designs found here were remade in FreeCAD, which is the parametric design software we officially support.
